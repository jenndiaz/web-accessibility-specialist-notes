# WCAG 2.2 AAA Guidelines 
Since most of my work prioritizes A and AA findings, I am reviewing AAA findings in this document. 
Synchronized media: Time based media paired with another format. For example a video with synchronized audio track and captions or a video with interactive elements like clickable links at certain times. 

## Perceivable 

### 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) 
Sign Language interpretation is provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.
Some Deaf people may not be able to read or comprehend captions as well as they could sign language. Sign Language translations gives these people access to synchronized media. 

### 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) 
Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficeint to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description is provided for all prerecored video content in synchronized media. 

### 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) 
An alternative for time based media is provided for all prerecorded synchronized media and for all prerecorded video only media. 
Text equivelents for all content videdos such as transcripts. 

### 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live)
An alternative for time based media that presents equivalent information for live audio only content is provided. 
Text equivelents for live audio only content, such as a transcript or planned script. 

## Operable 

### 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) 
All functionaility of content is operable through a keyboard interface without requring specific timing for individual keystrokes.
