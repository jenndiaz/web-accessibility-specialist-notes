# Domain One C: Create Interactive Controls/Widgets Based on Accessibility Best Practices Study Tasks  

## Five Rules of ARIA 

1. Don't use aria, if you can use HTML instead
2. Don't change native semantics
All interactive aria roles need to be operable by a keyboard
Don't use role="presentation" or aria-hidden="true" on visible focusable elements
All interactive elements must have an accessible name

## Coding to Standards

## Techniques for providing accessible names and descriptions 

## Custom Widgets Authoring practices, semantic structure, keyboard behavior, etc. 

## Keyboard interaction model of ARIA custome widgets. General keyboard patterns and patterns specific to certain types of widgets 

## Testing for accessibility acroess a variety of platforms, browser, and assistive technologies

## Determine when an inaccessible outcome is the result of flaws in the design versus poor support of the technology 

## Know when it may be appropriate to write code that overrides, supplements, or fixes bugs in browsers or assistive technologies (do this only with great care).
