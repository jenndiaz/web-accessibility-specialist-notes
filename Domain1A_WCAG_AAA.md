# WCAG 2.2 AAA Guidelines 
Since most of my work prioritizes A and AA findings, I am reviewing AAA findings in this document. 
Synchronized media: Time based media paired with another format. For example a video with synchronized audio track and captions or a video with interactive elements like clickable links at certain times. 

## Perceivable 

### 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) 
Sign Language interpretation is provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.
Some Deaf people may not be able to read or comprehend captions as well as they could sign language. Sign Language translations gives these people access to synchronized media. 

### 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) 
Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficeint to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description is provided for all prerecored video content in synchronized media. 

### 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) 
An alternative for time based media is provided for all prerecorded synchronized media and for all prerecorded video only media. 
Text equivelents for all content videdos such as transcripts. 

### 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live)
An alternative for time based media that presents equivalent information for live audio only content is provided. 
Text equivelents for live audio only content, such as a transcript or planned script. 

## Operable 

### 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) 
All functionaility of content is operable through a keyboard interface without requring specific timing for individual keystrokes. 
Same as 2.1.1 Keyboard but without the exceptions. 

### 2.2.3 No Timing 
Timing is not an essential part of the event or activity presented by the content except for non-interactive synchronized media and real-time events. 
Differs from Level 1 in that the only exception is for real time events. 

### 2.2.4 Interruptions 
Interruptions can be postponed or suppresssed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency. 
So that updates do not distract users. 

### 2.2.5 Re-authenticating 
When an authentication session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating. 
Users are able to continue where they left off in the event they are logged out.

### 2.2.6 Timeouts 
Users are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions. Tell users how long their session can be inactive before they may lose information. 

### 2.3.2 Three Flashes

### 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions 

### 2.4.8 Location 

### 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)

### 2.4.10 Section Headings 

### 2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) 

### 2.4.13 Focus Apperence 

### 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) 

### 2.4.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms 

## Understandable
