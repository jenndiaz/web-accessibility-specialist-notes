### Normative and non-normative information in WCAG 2.2.
Normative = required for conformance. 
Defines accessibility practices required for conformance and verification. Minimum to make websites accessible. 

Non-normative = never required for conformance, content identified as “informative”. 
Guidance and techniques for interpreting and confirming with the normative requirement. Changes more frequently than normative documents. 
The main content of WCAG 2.2 is normative. Non-normative is the intro materials, appendixes, diagrams, examples, and notes. Advisory info to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact conformance.
